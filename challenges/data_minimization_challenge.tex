\section{Network Usage Challenge} % TODO: I hope there is a better name for this challenge
This challenge will take place throughout regular games. The purpose of this challenge is to reward good network data usage strategies.

Network data usage will be evaluated by keeping track of the average number of sent bytes-per-robot $A_{bpr}$:

$$ A_{bpr} = \frac{1}{n} \left( \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{b_i}{t_i} \right) $$

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $b_i$ is the number of bytes sent by robot $i$
    \item $t_i$ is the uptime of robot $i$
    \item $n$ is the maximum number of robots active in the team (therefore if, for example, a team decides to play in the 7vs7 competition with 6 robots, the metric will actually cover the performance of that formation with $n=6$)
\end{itemize}


%Bytes sent will weigh differently towards the final score, depending on the game phase in which they are sent. Bytes sent when they're not expected like in ready phase or in set phase. In this case, the score would be the weighted sum of several averages $A^{\text{phase}}_{bpr}$, each one computed for each phase, each phase average weighted with a penalizing factor (a coefficient between 1 and 2), as in:

$$ A_{bpr} = \sum_{p \in \text{P}} c_p A^p_{bpr} $$

%where:

%- $P$ is the set of game phases $P = \\{ready, set, playing, ...\\}$
%- $c_p$ is a penalizing coefficient for that specific game phase (for example, we might penalize additional traffic in the ready phase by using a coefficient of $c_{\text{ready}} = 1.5)$

The final objective of each team is to minimize the $A_{bpr}$ average.

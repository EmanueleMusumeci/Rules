\section{Introduction}

%Since RoboCup 2021 will be held virtually around the world, owing to the ongoing COVID-19 situation and the Standard Platform League is taking on a new form that is designed to provide all teams an opportunity to competitively measure their skills in robot soccer within the current circumstances without any physical presence on a common competition site. Also, other local opens have been cancelled.
We plan to organize GORE 2022 (GermanOpen Replacement Event) from the 12th till 17th of April as a follow-up event to the GORE and want to offer remote 5 vs 5 games which were not possible for the last years. We plan to host games in Hamburg, Germany.

Due to a probably dense timetable, we will only offer a few time slots for testing technical challenges for the RoboCup 2022.

Live-streaming of videos will be incorporated into the event to keep the contact between teams alive as well as presenting an entertaining experience for the public and sponsors.

GORE gives teams the opportunity to compete remotely by deploying their code onto robots from a robot pool, which is an important step towards facilitating fully remote soccer games. The rules and the guidance for referees have been designed to ensure the safe operation and protection of robot hardware. Softbank Robotics will be on-site so some of the safety rules might be relaxed.

\subsection{Code of Honor}

We believe that all teams act fair during competition. Thus, we ask all participants to acknowledge a Code of Honor.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The safe operation of the robots is paramount, especially where teams deploy remote their software onto robots owned by other teams. Referees and participants should act to prevent damage to robots, and be proactive in enforcing rules  designed to minimize damage.
    \item Teams should endeavour to install bug-free and conservative software for remote games. Also, remote games feature elements of speed, there are strict consequences for damaging robots, and we hope no team will be prevented from competing due to these reasons.
    \item This is an official RoboCup event. So teams want to win the games and be the winner of GORE 2022 but play these games more in the sense of test games for the RoboCup 2022. Winning is \textbf{not} everything.
    \item In case a team detects malfunction robot during setup, teams can agree a replacement of this.
    \item MAC-Address of LAN adapter remains unchanged during the event.
\end{enumerate} 

It is our experience that SPL teams are extremely gracious and congenial, and we expect that the Code of Honor will be honored. However, violation of this code may result in immediate disqualification.

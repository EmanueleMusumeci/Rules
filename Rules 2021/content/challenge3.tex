\section{Challenge 3: 1 vs 1}

\subsection{Idea of Challenge}
% Patrick

Two teams play 1 vs 1 on one field against each other with remote setup or autonomously. Each player stays on its own side and tries to shoot balls in the opponents half to score points.
The games are organised in a ladder KO system and each winner proceeds to the next stage.

\subsection{Prerequisites}
% Patrick
- Basic requirements for teams
    - Be able to deploy remotely or to play autonomously
    - There will be multiple possibilities during the time until RoboCup to meet and exchange ideas and code
    - introduce remote and autonomous code sharing section on website / RC git
    - Every team has to host or have a replacement arena 
    - All teams who are not able can download the other teams images and play in their own arena against it (use the correct field dimensions json). These games are not part of the ladder system and are outside of the competition.
- Basic requirements for arenas
    - GC
    - Four NAOs V6
    - At least 3/4 field
    - field marks (penalty box is not required)
    - Two goals
    - 4 balls
    - Wifi
    - Remote (VPN) connection to arena network for remote setup / Teamviewer or RemoteDesktop Connection / mobile local network
    - Camera for remote setup or streaming
- Streaming
    - Streaming game to youtube/discord/zoom/BBB/...

- Field dimensions \& lighting situation
    - All selected arenas have to provide a standardised json file of the field dimensions, and images of the field from different angles and day\&night times with focus on the lighting conditions.
    - This file has to be loaded from the software somehow. (Idea image is independant from field dimensions json)

\subsection{Setup}
% Patrick

- Images storage
    - All autonmous teams and optional remote teams with own images have to store their image on a to be defined storage hoster (TUHH could provide a Nextcloud for this) at least 2 hours before the game starts.

\subsection{Rules}
% Arne
All rules from the current rule book apply, except for these changes:

- Starting position for robots
    - Robots start in their own half on the GC side of the field, height penalty spot

- Refereeing
    - Local team has to referee
    - Referee can prevent robot by crashing on ground if falling by catching it before
    - Team scheidet aus, wenn Laufen so schlecht, dass es zwei Spiele lange nur hingefallen ist

1. Only one field player is allowed per team. There is one replacement player.
2. The player is only allowed to stay in its own half except between the goal nets. Leaving this area results in a standard removal penalty (leaving the field).
3. The half time duration is 5 min from play (play-off-mode in GC). The game break is 5 minutes and no change of  the software is allowed. After the initial ready/set phases the game state remains in playing regardless of shot goals.
4. The game is performed with two balls on each side.
5. On each side the goal free kick positions are the starting points for the two balls.
6. Points will be counted by the referees and not by the GC.
7. Points can be scored by:
    - Shooting the ball in opponents half and it stops there (1 Point)
    - Shooting a goal (not own goal) (1 Point)
    - Touching the opponents player with the ball (0 Point)
8. If a player scores a goal (not own goal) the ball gets replaced by the referees on the starting point on its own side that is farthest from said player. The ball can directly be played again.
9. If a balls leaves the field the ball is placed on the corresponding kick in or goal free kick positions without applying the GC action (ball is instantaniously free).
10. If the score is equal for both teams the game duration gets extended for/by one minute. After each extension the score is evaluated again. At max 5 extensions are allowed. TODO: Final determination? Coin toss?
11. Teams playing with an autonomous player get a scoring factor of 2. Each point is multiplied by this factor.
12. Dive motions and wide stance is not allowed
13. Global Game Stuck

\subsection{Challenge execution}
% Arne
- Ladder system
    - KO system 
    - groups of 8 teams per Ladder
    - randomly assignement of teams to groups
    - losers of a match will play in additional ladders (To allow all teams to play at least 3 times)
    - Winners play games against each other
    - Timezones (Two games per day)
    - can only be finalized when the exact number of participants is known

\maketitle

At RoboCup 2015, the Standard Platform League will hold three different technical challenges, which are described in this document.

The scores earned in each challenge will vary in magnitude.  Hence, they must be scaled before calculating the overall technical challenge rankings.  Teams who do not participate in a challenge will receive 0 points for that challenge.  The team with the highest total score for a challenge will get 25 points for that challenge, while the team with the lowest total score for a challenge will get 5 points for that challenge.  A linear equation will then be fit to these two points, and each other participating team in that challenge will gain points for that challenge based on this equation.

Questions or comments on these rules should be mailed to {\small \url{rc-spl-tc@lists.robocup.org}}.

\section{Corner Kicks Challenge}

\begin{figure}[t]
\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.8\columnwidth]{figures/corner-kicks-challenge}}
\caption{Setup before each corner kick attempt. The robot $R_1$, which has to carry out the corner kick, is placed on the sideline with its feet touching a virtual extension of the penalty area's front line. The robot $R_2$ ist standing at the default penalty kick position, \ie 1 m behind the penalty mark. The ball is placed in the left corner of the field. Please note that during the challenge, several opponent robots will be placed on the field. Their positions will not be announced in advance.}
\label{fig:corner_kicks_challenge}
\end{figure}


The purpose of this challenge is to foster passing skills, team play, and the perception of opponent robots.

\subsection{Setup}
The ball is placed at one of the field corners next to one of the goals. Each participating team has to provide two robots (whose jersey color can be chosen freely, wearing no jersey is legal, too). These robots will be placed at the two predefined positions $R_1$ and $R_2$ (see Fig. \ref{fig:corner_kicks_challenge}). The initial game state is SET. Initially, there are no opponent robots. The time limit for this challenge are 3 minutes. \comment{Tim: Allowing more than 3 minutes makes the overall time slot for this challenge too large. We already stop the time after a goal. I do not believe that more time will lead to a more differentiated result.}

As of the start of the first participating teams, no changes of code or configuration are allowed for any participating team.

\subsection{Procedure}
The game state changes to PLAYING and the robots can start to carry out the corner kick. To achieve a goal, both robots need to have touched the ball. The robot at position $R_1$ has to be the first who touches the ball. There are no other restrictions regarding a minimum or maximum number of touches. If the other robot touches first, the game state changes to SET again and the corner kick is repeated.

If the ball leaves the field, it is placed in the corner again.

If the ball enters the goal, the game state changes to SET and the time stops. Both robots are put back on their start positions again.

After each goal, one opponent robot (standing and not moving) is added to the field to make the following corner kick attempt more difficult. The positions of the opponent robots will not be announced in advance. There will not be more than 4 opponents, i.e. after having scored four goals, the setup will remain constant. The configuration of the opponent robots will be the same for all teams. 

If an opponent becomes pushed, or a playing robots leaves the field or is fallen (everything according to the definitions in the normal rules), the game state changes to SET and the time stops. Both robots are put back on their start positions again.

\subsection{Score}
Each goal will be awarded with one point.
Before the first goal is scored, a team receives one initial point, if both robots have touched the ball.

\subsection{Origin, Color, and Handling of Opponent Robots}
The opponent robots will be provided by the other teams that participate in this challenge. Whenever a team has completed the challenge, it will provide its two robots as potential opponents for the next two participating teams. The last teams participating in this challenge have to provide their robots for the first participants. The Technical Committee will announce a detailed plan in advance to the challenge.

All opponent wear the cyan standard jerseys. \comment{Tim: We should specify the color of the opponent robots. Otherwise teams may not be able to distinguish them from their own robots.}

To avoid any unnecessary damages to the robots, the Technical Committee members that conduct this challenge can try to catch falling opponent robots and put them back in a standing position, if requested by the teams.

\section{Many Carpets Challenge}
\commentk{Matthias - I pulled over the proposal from last year, but it should be updates as needed.}
One frequently discussed topic is to exchange the current field carpet for a more challenging surface, \eg artificial lawn.
To assess the current state of the art regarding walking stability and to foster research into this direction, the \textit{Walking Challenge} has been prepared.

In this challenge, a participating robot has to walk over a number of different carpets. The layout of the carpets is depicted in Fig. \ref{fig:walking_challenge}.

\begin{figure}[th!]
\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.6\columnwidth]{figures/walking-challenge}}
\caption{The field layout for the Walking Challenge: Six pieces of different carpets are placed next to each other between the two penalty areas. Each piece of carpet is about 1 meter wide and 3 meters long. A participating robot starts in the center of a penalty area (the team can choose the penalty area), facing the goal on the opposite side of the field.}
\label{fig:walking_challenge}
\end{figure}

For each successfully mastered carpet, the robot can gain either 1, 2, or 4 points: 

\begin{description}
\item[1 point] for successfully traversing a carpet. A carpet is considered as \textit{traversed} if the robot has been completely on the carpet (\ie there has been a point of time at which both feet have been completely on the carpet) and has left it completely afterwards (\ie no part of the robots touches the carpet anymore). Between entering and leaving the carpet, there must be at least three steps. It does not matter if the robot has fallen during traversing the carpet.
\item[2 points] for successfully traversing a carpet and having been standing still for at least 2 seconds while being completely on the carpet. If the robot has fallen while being on the carpet, the 2 points will not be awarded. However, if successfully leaving the carpet, the robot can still achieve 1 point.
\item[4 points] for successfully traversing a carpet and making a full turn of 360 degrees while being completely on the carpet. If the robot has fallen while being on the carpet, the 4 points will not be awarded. However, if successfully leaving the carpet, the robot can still achieve 1 point.
\end{description}

The carpets will be arranged with the most difficult carpets close to the center of the field and the easiest carpets close to the goals. There will not be any gaps between the carpets. However, as the carpets are put on a standard field and are expected to have different heights, teams have to be aware that the overall configuration will contain multiple thresholds over which the robot has to walk.

A robot can only receive one score per carpet. The order of mastered carpets does not matter. The order of performed actions does not matter either. Therefore, it would be possible, for instance, to walk straight over all carpets (and gain 1 point for each carpet) and to return to some of the carpets afterwards to achieve higher scores on these carpets.

Each robot will be given 3 minutes to walk on the field. If a robot falls over and its get up motion fails on a particular surface, the team can request to relocate the robot to one of the starting positions (the team can choose a new starting position for each relocation).

The carpets will be brought to the competition by TC members and the teams. On site, all available carpets will be presented and six carpets will be selected by the TC for the challenge. The selection should cover a broad range of (un)evenness and slippage. Each carpet's difficulty is judged by the TC. All carpets will be green (in any shade) but do not need to be uniform.

\section{Realistic Ball Challenge}

\commentk{pulled over the 2009 text for now, need to consider how much to limit size and design (if at all).  Humanoid KidSize plays with FIFA size 1 balls.}

The most common techniques for object detection, specifically ball detection, in the RoboCup leagues mostly rely on color information. However, it is expected in the near future that visual cues like color will be removed to come to a more realistic setup with robots playing with a ``regular'' soccer ball, or even with any kind of ball. Therefore, the aim of this challenge is to test whether the robots can detect balls other than the orange ones on the field, and manipulate them as precise as they can manipulate orange balls.

Each team will be asked to bring (at least) one ball which is similar to the orange ball in size and weight but with different colors and patterns. The TC will pick 6 balls out of this pile; 5 of those will be used in the challenge and the remaining 1 will be spare. If one of the balls in the pile of 5 was brought by the competing team, then it will be replaced with the spare one to make sure that the robot tries to deal with balls that it has not seen before.

The robot will start from the intersection of one of the side lines and the center line, facing towards the center of the field. The balls will be placed randomly within an imaginary $3m \times 2m$ area (i.e. $1/4^{th}$ of the field) located at the center of the field. Also there will be two stationary robots on the field placed in such a way that they are not somewhere between the balls and the goals. The purpose of placing those extra robots on the field is to make sure that there are some \emph{non-ball} objects on the field. An example scenario is illustrated in Figure X.

The robot will have 3 minutes to detect the balls, walk towards them, and try to score as many goals as it can. It can kick the ball towards both goals. If the robot is able to score with all balls before the time is over, then the stopwatch will be stopped, time spent for scoring will be recorded, and the team will be awarded with a score of ($180 - \emph{spentTime}$), $180$ being 3 minutes in seconds. The robot will be awarded 20 points for each time it intentionally kicks the balls, and additional 50 points for each goal it scores. An intentional kick is defined as a kick that results in at least 1 meter displacement of the ball. Balls that go inside the goals or out of bounds will be removed. If the robot is not able to score after 3 minutes, then partial credit will be given based on whether the robot showed convincing attempts of detecting, tracking, and kicking the ball. Finally the teams will be ordered based on their scores and their scores will be normalized according to the scoring scheme mentioned in the introduction section.
